## Introduction

The retail industry generates vast amounts of data, and analyzing it can provide valuable insights that lead to better decision-making. This project aims to utilize Exploratory Data Analysis techniques to uncover hidden patterns and trends in the retail dataset, ultimately identifying opportunities to maximize profit and improve business performance.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is not included in this repository due to its size. However, you can find the data at [Link to Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lV7is1B566UQPYzzY8R2ZmOritTW299S/view). Please download the data and place it in the `data` directory before running the analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory data analysis process involves the following steps:

1. Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring data integrity.
2. Data Exploration: Understanding the distribution of variables, identifying outliers, and performing initial visualizations.
3. Statistical Techniques: Applying various statistical methods to uncover patterns, correlations, and dependencies within the dataset.

## Key Metrics and Trends

During the analysis, we will focus on the following key metrics and trends:

1. Sales Performance: Identifying top-performing products and categories based on sales volume and revenue.
2. Customer Segmentation: Grouping customers based on their buying behavior and preferences.
3. Seasonal Trends: Analyzing sales patterns across different seasons and identifying opportunities for targeted promotions.

## Data Aggregation and Summarization

Given the large size of the dataset, efficient aggregation and summarization techniques will be implemented to condense the data while preserving important information. This will enable us to analyze and visualize key metrics and trends effectively.
